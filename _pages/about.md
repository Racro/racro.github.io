## Research Statement
I aim to build open source frameworks that create real world impact while advancing academic research. I focus on transforming digital advertising through automated content moderation and detecting malicious actors in the ad supply chain. My past work includes empirical studies on privacy-enhancing technologies, propaganda, and harmful ads; using AI to detect contextual nuances and mitigate these issues at scale. Going forward, I aim to enhance user experience online by uncovering differential treatment, fighting fraud, and conducting large scale measurements to improve widely used tools.
