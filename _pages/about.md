I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I am advised by Prof. [Rachel Greenstadt](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rachel-greenstadt) and Prof. [Brendan Dolan Gavitt](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brendan-dolan-gavitt). My research sits at the intersection of web privacy measurement and machine learning, with a particular focus on developing solutions to measure privacy in online systems and using AI to mitigate privacy risks.

I earned my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2021. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on large-scale fuzzing of network programs to uncover vulnerabilities, under the supervision of Prof. [Giovanni Vigna](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and Prof. [Christopher Kruegel](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/christopher-kruegel).

Recently, my work has explored how adblocker users may receive differential treatment through the display of problematic ads. I have also contributed to the development of robust taxonomies of problematic advertisements and adblocker user concerns using review analysis. Additionally, I have investigated how large language models can generate propaganda and developed strategies to detect and mitigate such content.

I have had the support of various seniors and mentors who have guided me throughout my undergraduate life to pursue a research career. To continue the legacy, I am always available to help the ambitious undergraduate students who could benefit from my experience.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
