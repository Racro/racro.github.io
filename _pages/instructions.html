PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ THIS CAREFULLY.

I have been through the Ph.D. application process and luckily received admits from numerous universities. 
I have discovered that there are different subtleties people tend to ignore and treat the Ph.D. application
in a very similar fashion as compared to MS applications.

Send me a mail with the Subject - "Prospective Ph.D. applicant" if you want to discuss your application. 
In case you want to discuss anything about the cybersecurity field, use the subject - "Cybersec Discussion". 
Do choose your subjects accordingly in case you want to talk about anything different from these topics.

Note - MS applicants should prefer not mailing me because I find myself incompetent to advice them.

Meeting hours usually will be on Sunday (9 AM - 10 AM). Any changes would be communicated via mail.  

Thanks
Ritik
