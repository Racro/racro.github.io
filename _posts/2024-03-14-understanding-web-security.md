Web security is a crucial aspect of modern computing. In this post, I'll discuss some fundamental concepts and common vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages
   - Can be prevented through proper input validation and output encoding

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Tricks users into performing unwanted actions
   - Mitigated using CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies

3. **SQL Injection**
   - Occurs when user input is directly used in database queries
   - Prevented through prepared statements and input validation

## Best Practices

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Follow the principle of least privilege
